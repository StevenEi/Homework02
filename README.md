02 Professional Portfolio

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to make a professional portfolio for potential employers, co-workers and friends to view for more information about myself. The website displays a brief description of who I am, what projects and applications I've completed and how to contact me. The bottom section of this ReadMe details what some future changes to the website may entail. 

## What I Learned
This project taught me a lot of things:
-Coding takes a LOT of practice
-Some interactions and parameters will not work as you think (e.g. In CSS, the opacity of a child element cannot be easily changed if the parent element has a designated opacity)
-Refactoring is extremely important, my first revision of this website is sloppy and I will need to go back through and clean up unnecessary code
-Media queries are frustrating to deal with!

## Problems that need to be fixed
=Media Queries=
    -Need to investigate container properties for main section images so that the images don't become distorted for different media sizes
    -Need to apply media queries to header section
    -Aside and main section black-box containers do not flex 
=Resume Popup=
    -Resume popup does not show the entire link to the resume on GitHub
    -Resume popup is not clickable on apperance; it doesn't go anywhere

## Idea's for future revisions
-Add a section for "in development" projects and ideas for future projects
-Add another personal section going into more-detail about climbing because it's a passion of mine (possibly after clicking "About Me" in header? moving to Who Am I section doesn't do anything since page is so short)
